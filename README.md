# Credit Scoring Project

## **Project Overview**
Financial institutions need to accurately predict loan defaults to mitigate risk and optimise lending decisions. This challenge becomes particularly critical in Africaâ€™s rapidly growing financial markets, where diverse customer demographics and dynamic economic conditions pose unique challenges.

In this project, I aim to develop a robust, generalisable machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults for both existing customers and new applicants. The solution will incorporate unique factors relevant to financial markets and provide a foundation for designing a scalable credit risk scoring function.

## **Objectives**
1. **Prediction Accuracy:** Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the probability of loan defaults.
2. **Generalisation:** Ensure the model is robust and performs well across diverse financial markets.
4. **Business Impact:** Provide actionable insights to:
   - Improve decision-making.
   - Reduce financial losses from high-risk lending.
   - Facilitate expansion into new financial markets.

## **Key Deliverables**
1. **Machine Learning Model:** A trained and validated model capable of predicting the likelihood of loan defaults.

## **Data Overview**
- **Features:** The dataset includes customer demographic, financial, and transactional data.
- **Target Variable:** A binary indicator (1 for default, 0 for non-default) or a probability score.
- **Special Considerations:**
  - Imbalanced Dataset.

## **Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize/scale numerical features.
   - Handle class Imbalance

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create additional features based on domain knowledge.
   - Test interaction terms and transformations.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as grid search.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use metrics like F1-Score, Precision-Recall and Accuracy to assess performance.
   - Ensure the model generalizes well through cross-validation.
